## Description
Convert the Figma prototype to a presentation video by using SHOTSTACK API &amp; the Figma plugin.

## Why this plugin
A simple and quick way to create a beautiful video presentation of your interface without leaving your workspace on Figma. If you're making a prototype about your MVP and you're gonna demonstrate it, this plugin is the best way to convert your prototype into a real video presentation.

## How to use
1. Open Shotstack plugin on Figma
2. Select your frames
3. Download the presentation video

## Future posibilities
1. Publish on Figma community
2. User Authentication inside the app
3. Allow users to order their frames
4. Store users' videos on the gallery page of the plugin (History)
5. Make a tool to put the final video on the Figma presentation page(FYI, it's not possible to upload a video on Figma and play it during the presentation).

## Other plugins
I found this [plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/908257968215073824/SUPA---Figma-to-video)(after that I made this project) on the Figma community so if you compare it with the Shotstack plugin you can see that it is not possible to select all frames, instead, you can just work on a frame in the same time.
